# Content Based Recommender System for Kuairec Dataset
This project implements a content-based recommender system using the Kuairec dataset. The recommender system is designed to suggest videos to users based on the features of the videos they have previously watched. The project implements different feature ingeneering approches, and uses cosine similarity to find the most similar videos to the ones the user has watched. The recommender system is evaluated using precision and ndcg and map metrics.

# To run the project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a dataset/kuairec folder at the root of the project and download the dataset inside it to test the code.

# Remark:
The entry point is the report.ipynb file. It contains links to the different notebooks used in the project.
